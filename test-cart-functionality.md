# Cart Functionality Test Checklist

## ‚úÖ **Core Functionality Tests**

### 1. **Add to Cart**
- [ ] Add single item to cart
- [ ] Add multiple items to cart
- [ ] Add item with different sizes
- [ ] Add item with quantity > 1
- [ ] Verify item appears in cart immediately
- [ ] Test with invalid product data (should fail gracefully)

### 2. **Update Cart Items**
- [ ] Increase quantity using + button
- [ ] Decrease quantity using - button
- [ ] Set quantity to 0 (should remove item)
- [ ] Set quantity to negative (should be prevented)
- [ ] Rapid quantity changes (debounce should work)
- [ ] Update quantity for multiple items simultaneously

### 3. **Remove Items**
- [ ] Remove single item using trash icon
- [ ] Remove item when quantity = 1
- [ ] Remove multiple items
- [ ] Clear entire cart
- [ ] Verify cart is empty after clearing

### 4. **Cart Display**
- [ ] Show correct item count
- [ ] Display product images correctly
- [ ] Show product names, prices, sizes
- [ ] Calculate totals correctly
- [ ] Show delivery fee
- [ ] Handle missing product images gracefully

### 5. **Error Handling**
- [ ] Network errors during cart operations
- [ ] Invalid product IDs
- [ ] Unavailable products
- [ ] Authentication errors
- [ ] Server errors
- [ ] Invalid quantity inputs

### 6. **State Management**
- [ ] Cart persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Cart syncs between browser tabs
- [ ] Loading states display correctly
- [ ] Error states display correctly
- [ ] Optimistic updates work properly

### 7. **Performance**
- [ ] Large cart loads quickly
- [ ] Rapid quantity updates don't cause issues
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] No memory leaks

## üîß **Technical Implementation Tests**

### Backend API Tests
- [ ] GET /users/cart - Fetch cart
- [ ] POST /users/cart - Add item
- [ ] PUT /users/cart/:itemId - Update quantity

- [ ] Quantity updates persist
- [ ] Removed items are deleted
- [ ] Cart cleanup works

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Unauthenticated users can't access cart
- [ ] User tokens work correctly
- [ ] Session expiration handled
- [ ] Multiple user carts are isolated

## üêõ **Edge Cases to Test**

### Data Validation
- [ ] Invalid product IDs
- [ ] Missing product data
- [ ] Negative quantities
- [ ] Zero quantities
- [ ] Very large quantities
- [ ] Invalid prices
- [ ] Missing images

### User Behavior
- [ ] Rapid clicking on quantity buttons
- [ ] Multiple browser tabs
- [ ] Network interruptions
- [ ] Page refreshes during operations
- [ ] Browser back/forward navigation

### Product Changes
- [ ] Product becomes unavailable
- [ ] Product price changes
- [ ] Product is deleted
- [ ] Product images change

## üì± **Responsive Design Tests**

### Mobile
- [ ] Cart displays correctly on mobile
- [ ] Touch interactions work
- [ ] Quantity buttons are tappable

- [ ] Cart operations complete in < 1 second
- [ ] Large carts (50+ items) load in < 3 seconds

### Memory Usage
- [ ] No memory leaks after cart operations
- [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable with large carts

### Network Efficiency
- [ ] Minimal API calls
- [ ] Proper caching
- [ ] Optimistic updates reduce perceived latency

## üîí **Security Tests**

### Input Validation

- [ ] XSS attempts are blocked
- [ ] Invalid tokens are rejected
- [ ] Rate limiting works

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Users can only access their own cart
- [ ] Cart data is not exposed to other users
- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged

## üìä **Analytics & Monitoring**

### Error Tracking
